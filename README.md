First Full Stack App

As part of Week 8 and 9 of the Bootcamp this is a full stack app to allow entry of data to a MongoDB collection. Starting with a code-along with our tutor and some unfinished files supplied the task was to complete the code, correct any errors and develop full CRUD operations in a MERN stack. A little bit of stlye has been added which may be tweaked going forward.

# Todo Fullstack

## Backend Available Scripts

In the backend directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

## Frontend Available Scripts

In the frontend directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

## Backend folder
# controllers
contains the handler functions that will be executed 

# models
contains the file which the data of a todo item will 'look' like

# routes
will have all your routes followed by the request (in controllers) that will execute

## Frontend folder
# api
contains all the requests you will make from your frontend to your backend

# components
contains react components

# pages

### Tips
work on your backend first, use thunder client to test endpoints
